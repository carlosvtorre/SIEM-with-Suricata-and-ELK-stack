# SIEM Implementation and Testing Project

Welcome to the SIEM Implementation and Testing Project repository! 🚀 This project focuses on the implementation and testing of a robust Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution using Suricata, ELK Stack, and Filebeat.

## Project Overview

🔒 - This project aims to enhance network security and monitoring capabilities through the integration of Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system, with the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash/Filebeat, and Kibana).
  
📊 - The SIEM solution enables real-time analysis, visualization, and correlation of network security events, providing valuable insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities.
  
📥 - The lightweight and efficient log shipping capabilities of Filebeat are utilized for seamless log ingestion into the ELK Stack.
  
💻 - The project also includes a client setup with Apache and Filebeat to demonstrate log visualization and analysis.
